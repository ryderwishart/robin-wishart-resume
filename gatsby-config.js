I have worked with many of the strongest networking companies including Extreme Networks, Cisco, and HP, plus many years of fibre optic networking, plus being an early adopter of 10Gig networking. I have similarly many years of experience with several storage solutions but mainly NetApp and the last 2 years with Nutanix. I have pretty much seen all the server implementations from client server through distributed computing and cloud systems. My last environment was 300 PC's with a hand full of Mac's (communications and graphics team) plus another 200 mobile devices (laptops and tablets) with about 60 virtual servers, which are a mix of VMware and Hyper-V systems. Primarily Microsoft servers with about 10% Linux servers (Apache). Extremely strong focus on computer and network security including Firewalls and Virtual Local Area Network's (VLAN's).</p>

<p>I am a self learner and have always emphasized continuous learning. I have managed data centres and the entire Information Technology function. In particular, I have always ensured a strong security focus to the operations of the entire computer system and have extended this sort of training throughout the entire corporation. I have often been on the leading (not bleeding) edge of technical adoption through a variety of new standards. Things such as delivering the first municipal dark fibre optic network in BC, providing standardized high end computer components on all computers well before the market standards “caught up”.</p>

<p>I have also been an early adopter of selective cloud software-as-a-system (SAAS) solutions. I have also promoted a model of continuous learning leading to all the technical staff gaining undergraduate computer science degrees.</p>

<p>I am a founding member of the Municipal Information Services Association of BC (MISA BC)and have been active in sharing my knowledge there, particularly in the security space and cloud computing solutions.</p>

<p>In summary, I have been a leading proponent of new technology while ensuring solutions are functional, secure, cost effective and enhance customer service. I am a self learner and have always emphasized continuous learning. I strongly promote this within the entire team and out to the whole corporation.</p>`,
